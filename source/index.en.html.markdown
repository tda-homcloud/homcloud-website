# HomCloud

HomCloud is a data analysis software based on persistent homology.
The software is developed by 
[Hiraoka Laboratory](http://www.wpi-aimr.tohoku.ac.jp/hiraoka_labo/),
mainly by [Ippei Obayashi](http://www.wpi-aimr.tohoku.ac.jp/hiraoka_labo/obayashi/).

HomCloud consists of two parts,
a basic part (named homcloud-base) and
a advanced analysis part (homcloud-advanced).
These two parts work independently. 

The basic part is free software and you can use it freely.
Only by this part, 
you can run basic data analysis based on persistent homology.

The advanced analysis part is now not open because of funding issue.
Now we prepare academic license and academic we allow people people to use
the advanced part freely. If you want academic license, please give us an email.
For industrial companies, we provide the license for collaborative researches.
If you want to know the details, please contact our laboratory.
