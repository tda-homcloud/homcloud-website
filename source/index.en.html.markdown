# HomCloud

HomCloud is a data analysis software based on persistent homology.
The software is developed by 
[Hiraoka Laboratory](http://www.wpi-aimr.tohoku.ac.jp/hiraoka_labo/),
mainly by [Ippei Obayashi](http://www.wpi-aimr.tohoku.ac.jp/hiraoka_labo/obayashi/).

HomCloud consists of two parts,
a basic part (named homcloud-base) and
a advanced analysis part (homcloud-advanced).
These two parts work independently. 
HomCloud is free software and you can use it freely.
